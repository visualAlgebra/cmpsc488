## Build Instructions
### Development Server
To start up a development server:

#### If you have Python 2 installed:
```shell
$ cd cmpsc488 # Go to the directory of your local repo
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
#### If you have Python 3 installed:
```shell
$ cd cmpsc488 # Go to the directory of your local repo
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

The in your browser, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

If you don't use a development server, some javascript stuff may not work!
